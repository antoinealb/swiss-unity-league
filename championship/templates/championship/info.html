    <h2>How to participate</h2>
    Tell your local tournament organizer (TO) about our league and show them the <a href="{% url 'info_organizer' %}">Guide for Organizers</a> page! Your TO will then register their local events for the league so you can start collecting Qualification Points at those events.</p>
    <h2>Qualification Points</h2>
    Players can earn Qualification Points (QPs) at all tournaments
    participating in the league. QPs are awarded in the following three
    ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Match Points:</strong> A player receives QPs <strong>equal
            to the match points</strong> they earned during the swiss rounds of
            the tournament. (E.g. A record of 3-1-1 in swiss rounds awards 10
            QPs).</li>
        <li><strong>Participation:</strong> A player receives 3 QPs just for
            participating at the event.</li>
        <li><strong>Playoffs:</strong> The top 8/12/16 players receive extra QPs (explained later).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tournament Types</h3>
    There are 3 types of tournaments (SUL Regular, Regional, and Premier).
    Your local tournament organizer will assign one of these 3 types to each
    tournament they organize. Depending on the type of tournament, a different
    number of QPs will be awarded to the participants.</p>
    <h4>SUL Regular</h4>
    All normal events (weekly, FNM, Prerelease) at your local store or
    association are SUL Regular events.</p>
    <h4>SUL Regional</h4>
    SUL Regional events are medium-sized events for which people travel
    all around your canton to attend them. For each format your local
    tournament organizers can organize one of these events per month
    (1 Modern, 1 Limited, 1 Standard, etc. per month). SUL Regional events
    can be with or without a top 8.</p>
    <h4>SUL Premier</h4>
    SUL Premier events are meant to be huge tournaments for which people
    travel all around Switzerland. To make those events feel special and
    exciting your local tournament organizer can only host up to 2 of these
    events per year.</p>
    <h3>SUL Multiplier</h3>
    Each of the 3 tournament types has a different multiplier that
    increases the number of Qualification Points the players earn. SUL
    Regular events have a multiplier of 1x, SUL Regional 4x, and SUL Premier
    6x. The QPs earned for match points and participation (but not for
    playoffs) are multiplied with the given multiplier for the
    tournament.</p>

    Over the course of the season a player can earn a <strong>maximum of 500 QPs
        with all SUL Regular events</strong> combined, further points will be ignored.
    With SUL Regional and Premier events a player can earn an unlimited amount of points.
    <h3>Qualification Points with Playoffs</h3>
    Events with playoffs award additional Qualification Points according to the schema below.
    For SUL Premier events running a top 8 is mandatory.
    For SUL Regional events the tournament organizer can decide if they wish to run their
    event with playoffs or not (top 4 or top 8 depends on the number of players).
    </p>
    The QPs for 9th-12th and 13th-16th are only awarded if the tournament
    has more than 32 or 48 participants.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <em>Chandra plays a SUL Premier event (multiplier 6x) at her local gaming
        store with 41 participants. During the 5 Swiss rounds she
        manages to get 3 wins, 2 losses, and 1 draw (10 match points).
        She places 11th in the overall ranking. Therefore she receives 60 QPs
        (6x10) for the match points, 18 QPs (6x3) just for participating. Since the
        event has more than 32 players, she receives an additional 75 QPs for placing 11th.
        With this event she earns a grand total of 153 QPs.
    </em></p>

    <h2>Byes</h2>
    The best performing players at the league are awarded byes (free wins
    in the first rounds) for the invitational tournament at the end of the
    year. A player can have at maximum 2 byes, further byes will be ignored.
    Players can earn byes in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The top 5 players (with the most QPs) will be awarded 1 bye.</li>
        <li>The player of the year (top 1 with the most QPs) will be awarded 2 byes.</li>
        <li>SUL Premier events with more than 128 participants award 2 byes to the winner of the tournament.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>How do we finance this ?</h1>
