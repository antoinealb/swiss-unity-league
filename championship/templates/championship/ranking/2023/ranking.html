        Every year, participating Magic: The Gathering tournaments in Switzerland award SUL Points to players.
        At the end of the season (31.10.2023), the top 40 players with the most SUL Points are qualified for the
        two-day SUL Invitational tournament. The best players will also receive byes, allowing them free wins in
        the initial rounds of the SUL Invitational.
