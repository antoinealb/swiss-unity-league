    The Swiss Unity League (SUL) is a collaborative league in 2023
    between various Magic tournament organizers in Switzerland with an end
    of year 2-day invitational tournament with 3.5k+ Prizes.</p>
    Any organizer can register their tournament for the league to make it
    award Qualification Points (QPs). Players need to collect these QPs in
    order to qualify for the invitational tournament.</p>
    In the following we only explain the parts that are specifically
    relevant for tournament organizers. If you wish to understand how
    Qualification Points are awarded to players and to see more information
    about the end of year invitational tournament, please also read the <a href="{% url 'info' %}"><u>Guide for Players</u></a>.</p>

    <h2>Tournament Types</h2>
    You can register all of your tournaments for the league to make them award
    Qualification Points (QPs) to the participants. There are 3 types of tournaments
    (SUL Regular, Regional, and Premier). To each of your tournaments you can assign
    one of these types, which defines how many QPs your event will award. </p>
    To finance the prize pool of the invitational, organizers pay a fee
    to run SUL tournaments. The higher the fee that you pay, the more points your
    event will award to players. </p>

    <h3>SUL Regular</h3>
    All your normal events (weekly, FNM, Prerelease) will be SUL Regular
    events. From the organizers side there's no fee and therefore it allows
    you to award additional prizes to your player base for free. Therefore
    if you do not wish to finance the prize pool of the league or you do not
    have the necessary funds, it is still possible to participate in the
    league by running all of your events as SUL Regular events.</p>

    <h3>SUL Regional</h3>
    If you wish to make your local events more attractive for people in your canton,
    you can turn them into SUL Regional events.</p>
    For each format you can organize one of these events per month (1 Modern,
    1 Limited, 1 Standard, etc per month). </p>
    Running an SUL Regional event comes with a fee of CHF 2 per participant. The top 8
    is optional for regional events. If you decide to run a top 8 at a Regional event,
    then a further fee of CHF 15 needs to be paid.</p>
    SUL Regional events without top 8 can also easily be held on a
    weekday evening.</p>

    <h3>SUL Premier</h3>
    Every organizer gets the chance to organize 2 SUL Premier events per year.
    Since there is a very limited amount of SUL Premier events we expect people
    to travel all around Switzerland for them. </p>
    Running an SUL Regional event comes with a fee of CHF 3 per
    participant. The top 8 is mandatory and comes with an additional fee of
    CHF 75.</p>

    <h2>Organizational Overhead</h2>
    We try to make participating in the league as easy as possible
    through automating many workflows on the website. Here are the few tasks
    that still remain from the tournament organizer's side.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter your event details in the calendar on the SUL website. These
            will also link back to your website, which provides you with free
            advertisement.</li>
        <li>At the end of each of your events the results need to be imported on the
            SUL website. This can be done directly via link or PDF from Eventlink and
            Aetherhub. No points/standings need to be entered manually.
        </li>
        <li>The fees will be calculated automatically and you will receive an
            invoice every 3 months.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <em>Ajani wants to turn their Saturday Modern event with top 8 into a SUL Regional
        Event. He arranges for this with the League and creates the event on the website.
        Ajani's event runs well and he manages to have 22 players. Once his event is over,
        Ajani uploads the results on the League website, which immediately updates the ranking.
        Some time later, Ajani receives an invoice from the League for 22x2 + 15 = 59 CHF, which
        goes in the prize pool for the invitational.</em></p>

    <h2>Benefits for Organizers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertisements for your events through the Swiss Unity League event calendar.</li>
        <li>Players are motivated to participate in your events more regularly.</li>
        <li>Players from other regions that are also part of the league are motivated to travel to your events.</li>
        <li>Extra prizes at your weekly events in the form of QPs at no cost to
            you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>League Rules</h2>
    Tournaments participating at the Swiss Unity League need to be
    “Magic: the Gathering” tournaments in a single player format and run in
    real life. Digital SUL events on MTG Arena, MTG Online, or similar are
    not allowed.</p>
    <h3>Magic Tournament Rules</h3>
    SUL events need to be in accordance with the official <a
        href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr/"><u>Magic Tournament
            Rules</u></a> (MTR). The following exceptions and additional rules
    apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may allow proxies at SUL Regular and SUL Regional events.</li>
        <li>Number of Swiss Rounds
            <ul>
                <li>For SUL Regular events the number of Swiss rounds can be decided by
                    the TO individually.</li>
                <li>For SUL Regional events without top 8, the number of Swiss rounds
                    can be decided by the TO individually, but at maximum 5 rounds.</li>
                <li>For events with top 8 (SUL Regional or Premier) the number of Swiss
                    rounds (and playoff type) played in SUL Regional events needs to be in
                    accordance with what is specified in “Appendix E—Recommended Number of
                    Rounds in Swiss Tournaments” of <a
                        href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr-appendix-e/"><u>MTR</u></a>.
                    (e.g. 9-16 players play 4 rounds, 17-32 play 5 rounds, 33-64 play 6
                    rounds, etc.)</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tournament Logistics</h3>
    <h4>SUL Regional events</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>For each format you can only run 1 SUL Regional event per
            month.</li>
        <li>All different types of Limited events count as 1 format. Hence you
            can only organize one Draft, Sealed or combined Limited SUL Regional
            event per month.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>SUL Premier events</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You can only run 2 SUL Premier events per year.</li>
        <li>To run a SUL Premier event your venue needs to offer seats for at
            least 50 players.</li>
        <li>Players need to be able to register and pay online for the
            event.</li>
        <li>SUL Premier events need to be held on a Saturday or on a
            Sunday.</li>
        <li>Allowed Formats: Limited (any combination of draft and sealed),
            Standard, Pioneer, Modern, Legacy.</li>
        <li>Competitive REL is mandatory and at least one judge is
            required.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deviate from League Rules</h3>
    If you wish to deviate from the above league rules for a given
    tournament, you can ask beforehand for approval at <a
        href="mailto:leoninleague@gmail.com"><u>leoninleague@gmail.com</u></a>.
    Please also mention the reason why you wish to deviate from these
    rules.</p>
    Examples of such deviations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you wish to run more than 2 SUL Premier events per year.</li>
        <li>If you run a SUL Premier event in the format Legacy and you want to allow proxies.
        </li>
        <li>If you want to increase the number of Swiss rounds played at your
            SUL Regional event.</li>
        <li>If your venue doesn’t have the required 50 seats to host SUL Premier
            events.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Late joining Organizers</h2>
    Tournament organizers (TO) can join the league at any point during
    the year. In order to not disadvantage late joining TOs, until 30 April
    2023 TOs can register their past tournaments for the league to let them
    award Qualification Points retrospectively. After April, TOs can
    only submit their future tournaments for the league. Past tournaments
    can only be registered as SUL Regular events and not Premier or
    Regional.</p>
    <h2>Labeling your Events</h2>
    To make SUL events easily recognizable to players it is important
    that all SUL events are labeled in a consistent way. You should
    therefore mention the following details for each event in the event
    calendar of your own website:</p>
    <h4>SUL Premier and Regional</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The title of the event should mention that it's a SUL Regional or
            Premier event.</li>
        <li>The description of the event should mention the multiplier (4x or 6x) of the event,
            the distribution of points for the top 8/12/16 (if it has a top 8),
            and also link to the <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nI2IR7mjItosNU8_eYjaitAF3b6WaOugoskhxL9SxCE/edit#heading=h.90nh078x9b9r"><u>Guide
                    for Players</u></a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>SUL Regular</h4>
    It's enough to mention in the description that this is an SUL Regular
    event and awards points for SUL. It should also link to the <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nI2IR7mjItosNU8_eYjaitAF3b6WaOugoskhxL9SxCE/edit#heading=h.90nh078x9b9r"><u>Guide
            for Players</u></a>.</p>
    <h2>Finances, Liability, and
        Sponsoring</h2>
    SUL will be financed by sponsorships and the fees organizers pay at their
    SUL Regional and Premier events. The main organizer of SUL, the Leonin League
    association, will take all financial liability for SUL. Leonin League is a
    tournament organizer based in Zürich.
